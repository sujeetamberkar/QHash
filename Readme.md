# Post-Quantum Banking Platform

Our team Byte Brew Crew took a small step in preparing the world against quantum computers. Due to the rise of Quantum Computers, sooner or later all the traditional cryptographic methods which we use during banking transactions like RSA will be easily breakable.
We came across a new way of making transactions which is quantum-proof

Q-Hash is the first quantum-proof Banking prototype

## Sub Domains
### Account Creation
    - 1) Every client will generate a Private Key on his system. Using this private key. The user will generate a Public Key on his system.
    - 2) Using BB84 protocol, a safe way of communication is decided between the user and the server and  a secret key is generated.
    - 3) Now Public key is encrypted using the key generated by the "BB84 protocol" and sent to the server via a secure communication channel
    - 4) The server will push the key, username, and hash(Password) on the database
### Make Transaction 
    - 1) On Successful login, You can see your current balance, username, and wallet ID. 
    The user who wishes to send the money needs to type the recipient username, amount, and remarks.

    - 2) If the user has sufficient balance we will convert the transaction details into a JSON file and send it to the server.
    
    Blockchain
        a) To make it more quantum-proof, we are using a quantum random number generator to create a true random number 
        b) The server will generate a hash value reading the received JSON file and the random number generated by the Quantum Random NO generator using SHA3- 512 algorithms.
        c) Once the hash value is created, the transaction is added to the blockchain 
        d) After the successful addition of the transaction on the blockchains the client will generate a signature on his system using his private key. A PDF copy of the receipt will also be generated
    
        
    - 3) Verification 
        a) Any user can verify the transaction using the receipt generated after the transaction and the public key of the sender. 
        b) You will get a True or False response 
        {You do not need to log in for verification}

### Business model

    - 1) Due to the high cost of quantum computers,
    - 2) We feel as of now this method of payment is only available for transactions above 75k.
    - 3) We plan on generating revenue by charging a 1% fee on every transaction.
    - 4) Whenever there is a dispute or a need for transparency and reliability to prevent corruption, we recommend our payment model
    - 5) Possible customers are 
        a) Gov contracts
        b) Weapons Transaction 
        c) Luxury Shopping
